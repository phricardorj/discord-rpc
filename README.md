# A simple Discord Rich Presence
Discord is widely used for communication nowadays, I developed this RPC to teach a group of friends a 
little about the world of DiscodJS and introduce them to Discord Developer. The goal is to be simple, 
introduce the npm package manager and definitely make this RPC work with your Discord accounts!

## How to use?
- To work this RPC, you will first need to run an ``npm i`` and then create an ``.env`` with your ``CLIENT_ID="YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE"``, which you can get from the 
Discord Developer Portal.

- The configuration of RPC images is basically done in the Discord Developer Portal.

- Once everything is configured, customized, you are free to do whatever you want, even consume an API if necessary. Use your creativity!

- Para subir a aplicação localmente, use ``npm start``.
